      <h1>Have you ever wondered how factories influence rainfall?</h1>
      <p>
        As you scroll, factories begin to rise along the horizon. Each new facility
        represents the growth of human activity, while the clouds above still look
        thick, bright, and almost untouched.

      <h2>Factories release streams of SO₄-based aerosols into the sky.</h2>
      <p>
        Microscopic sulfate particles rise from smokestacks and drift toward the
        cloud layer. They are not water vapor themselves, yet they quietly reshape
        how clouds form, grow, and fade.

    <section>
     
      <h2>Excess aerosols can thin the clouds and make rain less likely.</h2>
      <p>
        As SO₄ particles accumulate, cloud droplets struggle to merge into raindrops.
        The clouds become patchy and faint, and once condensation weakens, rainfall
        starts to decline as well.
