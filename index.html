            <h2>The Quiet Shift in America’s Seasons</h2>
            <p>
              For more than a century, the rhythm of America’s seasons has been
              quietly shifting. Each winter storm and summer downpour carries
              the imprint of changing climate forces—some natural, others
              unmistakably shaped by human decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              From industrial-era pollution that once suppressed rainfall, to
              modern warming that fuels stronger moisture cycles and more
              extreme rain events, decades of atmospheric change are written
              into the long-term rise and fall of seasonal precipitation.
            </p>
            <p>
              By tracing these patterns across regions and through time, we can
              see how human activity has intertwined with Earth’s natural
              climate systems, reshaping when, where, and how much rain falls
              each year.

            <h2>From Smoke Stacks to Plowed Fields</h2>
            <p>
              Since the Industrial Revolution, greenhouse gases have warmed and
              moistened the atmosphere, allowing winter storms to carry more
              moisture and produce heavier cold-season precipitation. At the
              same time, early industrial sulfate pollution suppressed cloud
              formation in summer, limiting rainfall that would otherwise have
              increased. As air pollution declined, both winter and summer
              precipitation began to show clearer signs of strengthening.
            </p>
            <p>
              Land clearing, farming, and deforestation have altered how the
              surface stores and releases moisture, reshaping seasonal rainfall
              patterns. In summer, irrigation can boost humidity and enhance
              local storms, while over-plowed drylands become hotter and drier,
              reducing rainfall. In winter, changes to vegetation and soil
              modify surface energy and moisture, subtly influencing storm
              tracks and cold-season precipitation.

            <h2>Summer Rainfall by Region, 1850–2020</h2>
            <p>
              Around the 1930s, the summer rainfall in the Midwest and the South
              dropped sharply. This was the famous Dust Bowl drought—a classic
              case of human land use and climate working together. Over-farming
              and poor agricultural practices broke down soil structure; dust
              storms formed, rainfall decreased, and the region fell into years
              of severe drought. After the New Deal introduced soil conservation
              policies, rainfall and climate gradually recovered.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 1950s, there was another major drought, along with the
              peak of industrial pollution. Summer rainfall in the South, the
              West, and parts of the Midwest dropped again. After World War II,
              industrial emissions and sulfate aerosols from coal power plants
              rose quickly, forming a heavy pollution belt over the eastern and
              midwestern U.S. Studies show that these aerosols created a clear
              “drying effect” in summer and fall, partly canceling out the
              rainfall increase that greenhouse gases would normally cause—especially
              in the Southeast and South.
