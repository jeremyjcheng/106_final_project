            <h2>The Quiet Shift in America’s Seasons</h2>
            <p>
              For more than a century, the rhythm of America’s seasons has been
              quietly shifting. Each winter storm and summer downpour carries
              the imprint of changing climate forces—some natural, others
              unmistakably shaped by human decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Human activities since the Industrial Revolution changed seasonal rainfall.
              Greenhouse gases made the air warmer and wetter, leading to heavier winter precipitation.
              But early industrial sulfate pollution reduced summer rainfall by suppressing clouds.
              As pollution later decreased, both winter and summer rainfall began to increase more clearly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Land clearing, farming, and deforestation changed how the land holds and releases moisture, reshaping seasonal rainfall.
              In summer, irrigation can increase humidity and storms, while over-plowed dry areas become hotter and drier.
              In winter, changes in vegetation and soil affect surface energy and moisture, subtly influencing storm paths and rainfall.

            <h2>Along the long timeline of the past, some marks of human influence</h2>
            <!-- 新增 id，方便在 JS 里监听 hover -->
            <p id="industrial-text-1">
              Around the 1930s, the summer rainfall in the Midwest and the South
              dropped sharply. This was the famous Dust Bowl drought—a classic
              case of human land use and climate working together. Over-farming
              and poor agricultural practices broke down soil structure; dust
              storms formed, rainfall decreased, and the region fell into years
              of severe drought. After the New Deal introduced soil conservation
              policies, rainfall and climate gradually recovered.
            </p>
            <p id="industrial-text-2">
              In the 1950s, there was another major drought, along with the peak
              of industrial pollution. Summer rainfall in the South, the West,
              and parts of the Midwest dropped again. After World War II,
              industrial emissions and sulfate aerosols from coal power plants
              rose quickly, forming a heavy pollution belt over the eastern and
              midwestern U.S. Studies show that these aerosols created a clear
              “drying effect” in summer and fall, partly canceling out the
              rainfall increase that greenhouse gases would normally
              cause—especially in the Southeast and South.

              <h3>What have you done so far?</h3>
              <p>
                We decided to present our ideas using a slide-based website that
                allows users to navigate through our findings in an interactive
                and engaging manner. We gave a brief overview of how rainfall in
                the United States has shifted over the years, examining
                historical patterns and regional variations across different
                parts of the country. Through our analysis, we've demonstrated
                that rainfall will inevitably increase due to climate change,
                but we still have it in our control to influence the extent of
                these changes. If nations work together to lower carbon emission
                levels, future rainfall can be more predictable and less
                volatile, making it easier for communities to adapt and prepare
                for changing precipitation patterns.

                What will be the most challenging of your project to design and
                why?
              </h3>
              <p>
                The most challenging aspect of our project was determining how
                to present the data in a fun and engaging way that would capture
                and maintain the audience's attention. The change in
                precipitation levels might not be as significant or immediately
                noticeable as the change in temperature, so it can be
                challenging to convince the audience about the importance and
                urgency of our findings. We needed to find creative ways to
                visualize subtle changes in rainfall patterns while making the
                data accessible and meaningful to a general audience.
                Additionally, we are integrating our work from project 3 due to
                its similar theme of climate change and rainfall patterns,
                however, it is difficult to improve on the existing work and
                align it more with our current goal with this project.
