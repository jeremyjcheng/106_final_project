            <h2>The Quiet Shift in America’s Seasons</h2>
            <p>
              For more than a century, the rhythm of America’s seasons has been
              quietly shifting. Each winter storm and summer downpour carries
              the imprint of changing climate forces—some natural, others
              unmistakably shaped by human decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              From industrial-era pollution that once suppressed rainfall, to
              modern warming that fuels stronger moisture cycles and more
              extreme rain events, decades of atmospheric change are written
              into the long-term rise and fall of seasonal precipitation.
            </p>
            <p>
              By tracing these patterns across regions and through time, we can
              see how human activity has intertwined with Earth’s natural
              climate systems, reshaping when, where, and how much rain falls
              each year.

            <h2>From Smoke Stacks to Plowed Fields</h2>
            <p>
              Since the Industrial Revolution, greenhouse gases have warmed and
              moistened the atmosphere, allowing winter storms to carry more
              moisture and produce heavier cold-season precipitation. At the
              same time, early industrial sulfate pollution suppressed cloud
              formation in summer, limiting rainfall that would otherwise have
              increased. As air pollution declined, both winter and summer
              precipitation began to show clearer signs of strengthening.
            </p>
            <p>
              Land clearing, farming, and deforestation have altered how the
              surface stores and releases moisture, reshaping seasonal rainfall
              patterns. In summer, irrigation can boost humidity and enhance
              local storms, while over-plowed drylands become hotter and drier,
              reducing rainfall. In winter, changes to vegetation and soil
              modify surface energy and moisture, subtly influencing storm
              tracks and cold-season precipitation.

            <h2>Summer Rainfall by Region, 1850–2020</h2>
            <p>
              Around the 1930s, the summer rainfall in the Midwest and the South
              dropped sharply. This was the famous Dust Bowl drought—a classic
              case of human land use and climate working together. Over-farming
              and poor agricultural practices broke down soil structure; dust
              storms formed, rainfall decreased, and the region fell into years
              of severe drought. After the New Deal introduced soil conservation
              policies, rainfall and climate gradually recovered.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 1950s, there was another major drought, along with the peak
              of industrial pollution. Summer rainfall in the South, the West,
              and parts of the Midwest dropped again. After World War II,
              industrial emissions and sulfate aerosols from coal power plants
              rose quickly, forming a heavy pollution belt over the eastern and
              midwestern U.S. Studies show that these aerosols created a clear
              “drying effect” in summer and fall, partly canceling out the
              rainfall increase that greenhouse gases would normally
              cause—especially in the Southeast and South.

                allows users to navigate through our findings in an interactive
                and engaging manner. We gave a brief overview of how rainfall in
                the United States has shifted over the years, examining
                historical patterns and regional variations across different
                parts of the country. Through our analysis, we've demonstrated
                that rainfall will inevitably increase due to climate change,
                but we still have it in our control to influence the extent and
                predictability of these changes. If nations work together to
                lower carbon emission levels, future rainfall can be more
                predictable and less volatile, making it easier for communities
                to adapt and prepare for changing precipitation patterns.

                The most challenging aspect of our project was determining how
                to present the data in a fun and engaging way that would capture
                and maintain the audience's attention. The change in
                precipitation levels might not be as significant or immediately
                noticeable as the change in temperature, so it can be
                challenging to convince the audience about the importance and
                urgency of our findings. We needed to find creative ways to
                visualize subtle changes in rainfall patterns while making the
                data accessible and meaningful to a general audience.
                Additionally, balancing scientific accuracy with engaging
                storytelling required careful consideration of how to present
                complex climate data without oversimplifying or losing important
                nuances.
